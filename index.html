                    <h5 class="card-content">Nestled in downtown Raleigh, Bittersweet offers a truly unique experience with their menu of seasonal
                        and classic cocktails alongside fantastic desserts. As they say, they are a place where you can get
                        bourbon with your pie, champagne with your cake and Irish whiskey in your coffee.</h5>

                    <h5 class="card-content">
                        Alongside their alcohol and dessert choices, they have a full coffee and espresso menu. Desserts are baked in-house daily,
                        and they offer over 40 types of gin. If you're looking to relax and forget a hard days work, be sure
                        to look for their Mind Eraser- a coffee liquer and vodka shooter.</h5>

                    <h5 class="card-content"> The original Lucky 32 was opened in 1989 in Greensboro, this location opened in 2002. This wonderful
                        restaurant prides themselves on putting the guests and it's employees first and foremost. Their attention
                        to detail doesn't stop just the decor and service, but certainly can be noted in their food as well.
                    </h5>

                    <h5 class="card-content">
                        One of the most unique aspects, is the ability to go to their website and look directly at their recipes! Whether it's the
                        Smoked Ham & Cheese Dip you enjoyed or the Smoked Salmon Cakes, you'll find the recipes online and
                        available with no catch. However, don't let that stop you from going in person and enjoying a night
                        out.

                        Another gem in downtown Raleigh right near their sister restaurant, Bida Manda, is this one. A unique combination of a bar,
                        restaurant, flower shop, and bookstore. That's right, it is all those things in one and somehow beautifully
                        done.
                    </h5>

                    <h5 class="card-content">
                        The dim sum here is incredible. There's no arguing it's literal translation of "touch the heart" when you bite into a warm
                        dim sum and you just feel the warmth of the food and feel home. Don't forget to try a beer while
                        you're there as well. After all, it is called Brewery Bhavana for a reason.
